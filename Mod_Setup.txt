MegaPack_v1.zip is most mods combined into one pack.
Place MegaPack_v1.zip in 'The Riftbreaker Prologue\packs' folder.
If you haven't done so before you will need to open 'The Riftbreaker Prologue\conf\initial_config_win.cfg' in a text editor.
You will need to add the following to the end of the file:

set demo_mode 0
set g_enable_tutorials "0"
set enable_biom_select "1"

Note: if set demo_mode 1 is already there you can just change it to set demo_mode 0

If you want to select which mods to install remove MegaPack_v1.zip and add any of the zips you want to use in 'The Riftbreaker Prologue\packs' folder.
Descriptions for the mods can be found in Mod_Details.txt
